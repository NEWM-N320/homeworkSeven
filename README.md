## Web4 Link:

This assignment focused on implementing Props and Slots with Vue. It also allowed us to practice creating a local project in Vue. With this assignment, we were to create a form that displayed members of an array given to us, with the ability to let the user find members with different roles and IDs. We could add a developer, designer, or UX/UI designer to a team with the name of our choice.
